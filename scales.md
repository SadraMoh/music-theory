# Scales

## A scale is a collection of notes that are arranged by ascending or descending order of pitch

## There are many types of scales

- major scales  
- minor scales  
  
- major/minor pentatonic scales  
  
- blues scale  
- arabic (double harmonic) scale  
  
(and many more)  


## Scales are used to build `chord`s

## C major scale

C D E F G A B


## C minor scale

C D D#/Eb F G G#/Ab A#/Bb


## Major and Minor scale formulas

1. find the note you want the scale of on the keyboard/fretboard  
2. move up the freatboard/keyboard according to the distances in the formula  

W: whole step (distance of two frets/two keyboard keys)  
H: half step (distance of one fret/keyboard key)  

major: W W H W W W H  
  
minor: W H W W H W W  


### example of finding the C major scale

W    W    H W    W    W    H
C C# D D# E F F# G G# A A# B C 
^ !  ^ !  ! ^ !  ^ !  ^ !  ^ ^


## Any major scale can also be found using the `circle of fifths`

1. write out the notes in alphabetical order starting from the root note  
2. you can tell how many sharps or flats a key has by counting how far that key is from `C` (12 o'clock) clockwise.  

for example the key `A` (3 o'clock) is three steps away from `C` meaning there must be three sharps in the `A` major scale.  

3. sharpen the notes you wrote on step 1 according to the order of sharps  

the order of sharps is as follows `F C G D A E B`  


### example of finding the C major scale using the circle of fifths

> notes in alphabetical order `A B C D E F G`  
> `A` is three steps away from `C` (counting clockwise) so there must be three sharps  
> The first sharp is `F`, followed by `C` and then `G`  
> `A B C# D E F# G#`
