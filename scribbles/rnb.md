# Recipe for NEOSoul progression

Pick a MINOR key.

pick two or three chords from that key. (most in style to pick a minor 7th or major 7th chord but anything goes)

spread the chords in a _,_,_,_ four bar grid. (no two chords should be more than one bar apart)

fill the empty bars with Diminished 7th chords. 
The diminished chord to choose MUST be half a step below the chord next to it.
(choose your diminished 7th chord shapes to be close to your original chords)

### Example:

pick a minor key: Dm

Scale: D E F G A Bb C

Chords:     Dm Edim F Gm Am Bb C
7th Chords: Dm7 Em7/b5 Fmaj7 Gm7 Am7 Bbmaj7 C7

Chosen: Dm7 Bbmaj7
